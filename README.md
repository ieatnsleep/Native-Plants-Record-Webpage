# Native-Plants-Record-Webpage

This webpage have a collection of native plant records and images collected during my internship with NParks. I wish to show the diverse biodiversity of native plant species I encountered in Singapore.
If you wish to use any of my plant images in this repository, please do drop me a message in my email.
